# Module boundaries for apps/macOS — the Swift counterpart of dependency-cruiser, which
# cannot see Swift. Scans the whole tree and ignores any arguments, so lint-staged may
# append staged paths without changing what is checked: a boundary is a property of the
# tree, not of the file you happened to touch.
#
# The three edges are ADR-0022's layering, and each is checkable by looking at imports and
# declarations alone — which is the whole reason they are gates rather than review notes.
