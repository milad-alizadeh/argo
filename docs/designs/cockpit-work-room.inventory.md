# The Work room — inventory

What `design-to-code` extracted while building [`cockpit-work-room.md`](cockpit-work-room.md), and
what it deliberately left inline. One row per component the assembled screen forced out.

**Scope: #812 only** — the views sidebar, the flat backlog list and the ticket, on fixtures. The
design freezes 31 names across the whole room; the eleven below are the ones this ticket built. The
rest (the hero, the toolbar, the tree, the fact strip, the Delivery chips, the link lists, the
vacancy panel, the Route) belong to their own tickets and are absent rather than stubbed.

## Extracted

| name | tier | location | props | composed-of | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `WorkRoom` | organism | `ArgoUI/Shell/Work/` | `room: Room`, `cockpitRoom: Binding<CockpitRoom>`, `ticket: Binding<Int?>` | `WorkSidebar`, `BacklogList`, `TicketDetail`, `DeckSeparator` | `WorkRoom` |
| `WorkSidebar` | organism | `ArgoUI/Shell/Work/Sidebar/` | `room: Room`, `cockpitRoom: Binding<CockpitRoom>` | `RoomStrip`, `GroupLabel`, `ViewRow`, `ProviderFoot` | `WorkSidebar` |
| `RoomStrip` | atom | `ArgoUI/Shell/Work/Sidebar/` | `selection: Binding<CockpitRoom>` | stock `Picker(.segmented)` | `RoomStrip` |
| `ViewRow` | molecule | `ArgoUI/Shell/Work/Sidebar/` | `symbol: String`, `name: String`, `count: Int` | `ArgoGlyph` | `ViewRow` |
| `ProviderFoot` | atom | `ArgoUI/Shell/Work/Sidebar/` | `provider: WorkProvider` | `SessionStateIndicator` | `ProviderFoot` |
| `BacklogList` | organism | `ArgoUI/Shell/Work/Backlog/` | `rows: [Row]`, `selection: Binding<Int?>` | `BacklogRow` | `BacklogList` |
| `BacklogRow` | molecule | `ArgoUI/Shell/Work/Backlog/` | `row: Row` | `DeliveryDot` | `BacklogRow` |
| `DeliveryDot` | atom | `ArgoUI/Shell/Work/Backlog/` | `reading: DeliveryReading` (5 states) | — | `DeliveryDot` |
| `TicketDetail` | organism | `ArgoUI/Shell/Work/Detail/` | `ticket: Ticket?` | `TicketHead` | `TicketDetail` |
| `TicketHead` | molecule | `ArgoUI/Shell/Work/Detail/` | `ticket: Ticket` | `StatusPair` | `TicketHead` |
| `StatusPair` | atom | `ArgoUI/Shell/Work/Detail/` | `word: String`, `bucket: WorkItemState` (4 states) | — | `StatusPair` |

One name the design does not freeze was extracted anyway:

| name | tier | location | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GroupLabel` | atom | `ArgoUI/Atoms/` | `Section("…")` takes the platform's sidebar header — title case at the body rung — and the contract froze `sectionLabel`, uppercase at 11 with tracking. Both groups need it, which is the repetition that forced it out. In `Atoms/` rather than under `Work/`: a group label is not the Work room's. |

## Stayed inline

- **The deck's two-pane split.** One `HStack` in `WorkRoom.deck` with `DeckSeparator` between —
  single-use, single-state, and `SessionsDeck` already owns the shape it would be extracted into.
- **The ticket's body.** A `Text` at `ArgoFeedRow`'s line spacing inside `TicketDetail`, behind
  `argoFeedMeasure()`. Its section headings are #813's role, so there is no markup to render yet
  and nothing an extracted view would hold.
- **The room strip's row in the sidebar's scroll.** One `previewSafeListRow()` call.

## Where the design and the code disagree

Three, each a defect in the design rather than a decision made here:

- **`ArgoLayout.statusDotSize` does not exist.** The dot is `ArgoIconSize.statusDot`, same value
  (6), and the design names the wrong enum. No token moved.
- **`ArgoTypography.sessionTitle` did not exist.** The design's table calls the ticket title's
  17-semibold an "exact tuple" of a role the contract never had; `identityHeading` is 15. Added as
  `interface · title2 · semibold` — a second contract promotion beside #813's `bodyHeading`, which
  the design *did* flag.
- **The sidebar's counts do not add up in `rest.png`.** It shows 12 open, 6 unblocked, 8 blocked.
  Unblocked and Blocked partition the open set, so the three cannot all hold. The code keeps the
  partition and the fixture reads 12 / 4 / 3 / 8.

## Not reproduced from `rest.png`

The render carries the whole room. This ticket's specimen reproduces its sidebar, its backlog list
and its ticket pane. The priority headers, the twists, the Next-up hero and the room's toolbar are
absent because they are other tickets — not because they drifted.
